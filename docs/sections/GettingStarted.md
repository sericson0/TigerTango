# Getting Started
To get to playing music, we follow the steps of:
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  - [Configuring Audio](#configuring-audio)
  - [Warnings and Settings](#warnings-and-settings)
  - [Playing Music](#playing-music)
  - [Next Section ➡️ TigerTango Layout](#next-section-️-tigertango-layout)

## Configuring Audio
For Virtual DJ to work correctly, you need to configure your audio to play how you want it.

1. Click on settings
2. Select the Audio tab (looks like a speaker)
3. Select Speaker only or Speaker + Headphones. Setting speaker + headphones gives you the ability to use headphones for prelistening.
4. Select where you want your speakers and headphones to play from.
>[!IMPORTANT]
> When in doubt, select **chanel 1 & 2** for your *master* out. 

>[!WARNING]
Make sure to send headphones to a different output than the master speakers.

5. Select Apply to accept the configured changes.

## Warnings and Settings
Virtual DJ is designed with club DJs in mind. This means many of the defaults are poor choices for tango DJs. TigerTango automatically sets several settings to ones that tango DJs will want. In addition, TigerTango has implemented a [Warnings Lighs area](Layout.md/#warning-lights). If a setting is improperly configured, then a warning light will come on. 
> [!WARNING]
> A warning light indicates an improper setting. This can lead to errors! Click the warning light to change to recommended setting.   

In addition, there are some settings that you may find useful to set (You can change settings by clicking settings -> options and then search for the settings name): 
* **resetEQOnLoad** -> **Yes**. This will reset your deck EQ from one track to the next.
* **resetFXOnLoad** -> **Yes**. This will reset deck effects from one track to the next (Will not affect master effects)
* **coverDownload** -> **No**. Prevents Virtual DJ from automatically trying to download album cover if not included in metadata (For tango songs it often downloads the wrong cover).  

## Playing Music
Virtual DJ connects with your music folder and other libraries such as Itunes. The browser area in the bottom part of TigerTango allows you to search for music. See the [Browser Section](Layout.md/#browser) for more details. 

There are two ways of loading a song in TigerTango. 

1. **Loading directly to deck**. Dragging a song from the browser area to a deck dropzone (the deck turntable. See the [dropzone subsection](Layout.md/#drop-zone) for details). Pressing play will start this track. Loading directly to deck is especially useful for DJing during performances, where you want control over when the next track starts.
2. **Playing from Automix**. Automix is the Virtual DJ term for playing from a playlist. This is similar to how Itunes or Spotify works, where when one track ends the next one in the list will begin playing. The Staging area in the middle of TigerTango is for the Automix playlist. See the [Staging Area Section](Layout.md/#staging-area) for details on using automix. 

>[!WARNING]
>There are some nuances to using the virtual DJ automix that are worth reading about. Please Read the [Staging Area Section](Layout.md/#staging-area) to get familiar with the specifics of Virtual DJ automix.
