# Getting Started
To get to playing music, we follow the steps of:
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  - [Configuring Audio](#configuring-audio)
  - [Warnings and Settings](#warnings-and-settings)

## Configuring Audio
For Virtual DJ to work correctly, you need to configure your audio to play how you want it.

1. Click on settings
2. Select the Audio tab (looks like a speaker)
3. Select Speaker only or Speaker + Headphones. Setting speaker + headphones gives you the ability to use headphones for prelistening.
4. Select where you want your speakers and headphones to play from.
>[!IMPORTANT]
> When in doubt, select **chanel 1 & 2** for your *master* out. 

>[!WARNING]
Make sure to send headphones to a different output than the master speakers.

5. Select Apply to accept the configured changes.

## Warnings and Settings
Virtual DJ is designed with club DJs in mind. This means many of the defaults are poor choices for tango DJs. TigerTango automatically sets several settings to ones that tango DJs will want. In addition, TigerTango has implemented a [Warnings Lighs area](Walkthrough.md/#warning-lights). If a setting is improperly configured, then a warning light will come on. 
> [!WARNING]
> A warning light indicates an improper setting. This can lead to errors! Click the warning light to change to recommended setting.   

In addition, there are some settings that you may find useful to set (You can change settings by clicking settings -> options and then search for the settings name): 
* **resetEQOnLoad** -> Yes. This will reset your deck EQ from one track to the next.
* **resetFXOnLoad** -> Yes. This will reset deck effects from one track to the next (Will not affect master effects)
