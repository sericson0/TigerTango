# Plugins

Tango DJs and Club DJs are opposites: *Club DJs play high quality recordings of low quality music while tango DJs play low quality recordings of high quality music* ;-) Jokes aside, what club DJs do is mix and modify parts of songs to enhance the energy and flow in the room, whereas when tango DJs modify a song it is primarily to remove artifacts such as hiss or enhancing the sound quality of the recording such as by boosting or reducing certain frequencies. 

There are a number of possible plugins that you DJs may find useful:
* Parametric equalizer for removing hiss and clarifying sound
* Limiter 
* Tape or saturation plugin for some songs
* Audio visualizers (more useful for understanding music than active DJing)

Here I give an example of how you could install a parametric equalizer. Enhancing the sound quality of older recordings can be done with EQing. While there is a 3-band semiperametric EQ built into the TigerTango skin, more advanced EQ plugins can be installed.

Here I show how to install *TDR NOVA*, a powerful and free parametric EQ by Tokyo Dawn Records.

1) Go to https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova/ and select the correct installer for your computer
2) Run the installer on your computer. 
> [!NOTE]
> Take a note of the folder path where the installer saves the **VST3** file to.
3) Accept the license agreement and click through next on each popup.
4) Open Virtual DJ options, search **vstFxFolder**, and set to where your VST3 files save to. On Windows this is "C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3"
5) Close and restart Virtual DJ
