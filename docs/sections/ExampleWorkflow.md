# Example Workflow
This section walks through how you could use TigerTango for DJing.

## Prework
* Create subfolders, such as most liked tracks by artist, period, and singer in the browser panel.
* Add playlist and folder shortcuts to the side view area. For example, you could have shortcuts to cortinas, vals tandas, milonga tandas, modern orchestras, and alternative tandas
* To help with visualizing your tandas, use the color button to set colors by genere, and use the record button to make dummy tracks for tanda breaks 
* Use the sidelist to start planning tandas and potential flow.
* Create dummy tanda breaks or silence inserts using the record button.

## Before Your Set
* Choose single or dual deck automix 
* Choose automix type and gap duration
* Choose whether to play to Stereo or Mono
* Fill the effects positions with effects you may want to use such as with an equalizer and a limiter.
* Configure the video display if you are displaying song information.
* Choose your desired AUTO FADE length. 
* Drag your first few tandas into the staging area
* 
## During Your Set
* Click AUTO to begin playing. This will loop through the playlist one song at a time.

* Use the **Prelisten** button on the non-active deck to listen to the up upcoming song.
* Use the deck effect and master effects areas to do any needed EQing or addition of other effects.
* The **AUTO FADE** button can be used to fade out a cortina and allow the automix to continue as desired.
* For performances, Turn off the Automix and load one deck at a time into the player. This will ensure that the next sond does not start playing before the performers are ready.
*  Once performances are over you can restart **AUTO** to continue the night.

## After Your Set
* Click the save button to save your set to a playlist for future reference
* Open the automix in the side view panel, click the settings button, and clear the automix so you have a clean slate for your next set.
* Tell your other DJ friends about TigerTango ;-)
