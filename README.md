By: Sean Ericson (Sericson0@gmail.com)

A good Tango DJ can enables dancers to find that magical flow and connection we all crave. The art of picking the perfect tandas requires untold hours of study and practice. And nothing kills the magic you are working so hard to create like technical issues. Your DJ software should enable your creativity and not be a hindrance to the flow you are striving so hard to create. This is why I created the TigerTango skin for Virtual DJ. It provides a layout custom suited for the needs of and requirements of tango DJs and other social dances.

## What DJs are Saying About TigerTango
>The TigerTango VirtualDJ skin interface from Sean Ericson is perfect for Tango DJs. As a Traktor user for the last 10 years I never stopped looking for a more practical alternative, until now. Sean’s dedication to develop and test the interface gradually, together with the wider tango community, supports further customisation and safe usage on one of the most popular DJ programs.

>Until now, software for Tango DJing meant compromise: too little, or way too much. Endless configurations or constant fear of misclicks on cluttered screens. TigerTango fixes this. Designed and tuned for Tango DJs, its interface and unique features finally fit our craft.

>It is totally awesome, making tango DJ-ing wonderfully streamlined on the technical side. I have DJ-ed with MediaMonkey before and test-drove other DJ software. VDJ with TigerTango blows all of them out of water. Loving it!!!  Thank you, Sean!

## What is TigerTango? 
Playing music requires a **software interface**. For everyday purposes, programs like Spotify or Itunes suffice, but they fall short of the needs of the tango DJ. They often do not include functionality such as prelistening, can have issues with audio quality, and are missing some essential safety features (one wrong button and you start the next track). Tools such as Virtual DJ, Traktor, and Serrato meet some of these needs such as providing stable and reliable sound, including audio equalizers, and integrating with third party plugins such as EQs and limiters. But DJ tools have their own issues that make them far from ideal for tango DJs.
* They include many features not used for tango such as deck scratching
* Can be difficult to configure appropriately
* Often cost money

For years, tando DJs have been struggling with the choice between underpowered interfaces such as Itunes, or DJ software not set up for their needs. This is where TigerTango comes in. 

TigerTango is a customized Virtual DJ skin that is specifically designed for the needs of a Tango DJ. It provides a powerful array of features.
* Provides the full power and reliability of a dedicated DJ software
* Removes unused features to provide a clean interface
* Configuration set up speifically for tango DJing, so you don't have to spend hours figuring out the settings needed to get the program to work. 
* Adds an array of safety features. The less you have to worry about your tool, the more you can focus on providing the best experience for the dancers!
* Integrates any VST3 plugin directly into the interface
* Includes buttons to fade out cortinas
* Semiparametric equalizer built into the interface
* Integrates seamlessly with video skin for DJs interested in displaying song and artist information, tanda position, and even song lyrics and translations!
* Free for all to use. 


## Why TigerTango? 
I teach and help organize the Princeton Tango club (New Jersey, USA). Their mascot is a tiger, so the neame was a natural choice.

## Aknowlegements
This project would not have been possible without the substantial time and expert support from several members of the Tango community.

Huge thank you to **Chris Hart** and **Andrew Hart**. The layout, look, and functionality of TigerTango has been so much improved because of their efforts and support.
